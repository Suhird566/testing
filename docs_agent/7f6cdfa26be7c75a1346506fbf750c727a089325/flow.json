  "architecture": "Client interacts with a FastAPI API server. The API uses SQLAlchemy to manage a database session and persist Organization entities in a relational database. The models are defined in models.py and the request/response schemas in schemas.py.",
  "api_flow": "1. Client sends GET / or POST /organizations or GET /organizations.\n2. FastAPI routes to the appropriate handler.\n3. Each handler obtains a SQLAlchemy Session via the get_db dependency.\n4. For POST, a new Organization model instance is created, added to the session, committed, refreshed, and returned.\n5. For GET, the session queries all Organization records and returns them.\n6. Responses are returned as JSON.",
  "core_logic": "Create organization: instantiate models.Organization with data from schemas.OrganizationCreate, add to DB session, commit, refresh, return the persisted object. List organizations: query all models.Organization instances via DB session and return the list.",
